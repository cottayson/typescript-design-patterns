# What a design pattern?
Design Pattern - is a general solution to common software design problems.
Like a blueprint or a template that you can modify to solve your particular problem.

## Main types of design patterns:
* Creational patterns `(factory, constructor, singleton, ...)`
  + Promote flexibilty and reusability of code in situations where
  you have to create many different types of many different objects
* Structural patterns `(adapter, facade, proxy, ...)`
* Behavioural patterns `(observer, command, iterator, ...)`
